Identification of the selected types of substructures in the opinion networks
=============================================================================

Introduction
----------------
In this work we will consider the problem of identifying different types of structures and substructures in opinion networks. The formal definition for the term opinion network was not proposed yet, but informally it can be described as a collaboration network representing opinions amongst a set of particular agents, e.g. individual users of message boards. A collaborative network is a network that consists of agents that are mostly autonomous and heterogenous, but that cooperate to achieve some kind of a common goal. The interactions of such network are generally supported by computer networks.

Motivation
--------------
Due to the hypothesis that some agents may be dishonest and may, for example, create multiple accounts on message boards to either advertise and/or malign certain brands of products it is desirable, if not necessary, to filter out quasi-opinions posted by such agents. For many message boards, like the one examined during writing of this thesis, honest and unpolluted opinions are key factor in retaining its reputability. Without the possibility to identify and remove unwanted opinions it is easy to decline and lose the user base. How- ever, one has to note that there is no sure and reliable way of doing it automatically or applying it in a generic way across different opinion networks.
Because of the character of the thesis the assumption was to download messages from one of the message boards and create a complex network using obtained data. Then it was proposed to analyse newly established complex network using several already known methods and/or develop new methods if necessary.
